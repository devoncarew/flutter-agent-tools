## 1.1.0

### `slipstream_agent` companion integration improvements

When `package:slipstream_agent` is installed in the target app, inspector tools
now report their activity to the companion's ghost overlay:

- `take_screenshot` suppresses the Flutter debug banner before capture and
  restores it afterward (via `ext.slipstream.overlays`)
- `reload` and hot restart log the operation with elapsed time
- `evaluate`, `inspect_layout`, and `perform_semantic_action` log their
  invocations with relevant context (expression snippet, widget ID, action
  target)
- Hot restart timing is handled correctly: the log fires after the companion
  re-registers its extensions post-restart

## 1.0.0

Initial public release.

### Package currency hook

- Warns when an agent adds a discontinued package (with official replacement if
  one is listed)
- Warns when a constraint targets an older major version than the current
  pub.dev release
- Warns when a package name is not found on pub.dev
- Fires on `flutter pub add` / `dart pub add` and on direct `pubspec.yaml` edits
- Always exits 0 — advisory only, never hard-blocks

### `packages` MCP server

- `package_summary` — version, entry-point import, README excerpt, public
  library list, and exported name groups
- `library_stub` — full public API for one library as a Dart stub file
  (signatures only, no bodies)
- `class_stub` — stub for a single named class, mixin, or extension

### `inspector` MCP server

- `run_app` — builds and launches a Flutter app; auto-selects the best available
  device (desktop > simulator > emulator > physical > web)
- `reload` — hot reload or hot restart
- `take_screenshot` — PNG screenshot via the inspector protocol
- `inspect_layout` — widget layout tree (subtree depth configurable)
- `evaluate` — arbitrary Dart expression on the main isolate
- `get_route` — navigator stack with screen widget names and source locations
- `navigate` — route navigation via registered router adapter (requires
  `slipstream_agent` companion)
- `get_semantics` — flat list of visible semantics nodes with role, ID, state,
  actions, label, and position
- `perform_semantic_action` — semantics action (tap, longPress, setText, …) by
  node ID or label
- `perform_tap` — finder-based tap (byKey/byType/byText/bySemanticsLabel);
  requires `slipstream_agent` companion
- `perform_set_text` — finder-based text field input; requires companion
- `perform_scroll` — scroll a Scrollable by fixed logical pixels; requires
  companion
- `perform_scroll_until_visible` — scroll until a target widget is in the
  viewport; requires companion
- `close_app` — stops the running app

### `slipstream_agent` companion integration

When `package:slipstream_agent` is installed in the target app, the inspector
server detects it via `ext.slipstream.ping` and activates enhanced mode:

- Finder-based widget interaction (byKey, byType, byText, bySemanticsLabel)
- Router-adapter navigation (GoRouter and others)
- Semantics nodes with accurate screen-space coordinates
- `[window]` log messages on resize
- `[route]` log messages on navigation
